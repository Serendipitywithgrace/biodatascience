Hi! Iâ€™m Xin Yun, currently a Y2 DSAI student. Even though I'm not that good at it, my passion is singing and I love to spend my free time humming to catchy tunes. My project is focused on transductive learning, mainly on exploring how the distance concentration effect manifests in biological data and how it influences various clustering algorithms.
