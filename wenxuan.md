My project aims to search for meaningful patterns in TCM datasets using data mining techniques and analysis. Our first goal is to conduct hierarchical clustering, using the 十问歌(10 basic questions) and other common features as the features for the patient’s condition, to classify the patients and compare this classification to the physicians’ diagnosis. Other goals include searching for batch effects by different physicians and predicting the development/occurrence of diseases from past records.
