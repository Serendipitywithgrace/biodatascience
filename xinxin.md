I’m Zhang Xinxin, a Master student specialised in Biomedical Data Science. With previous industrial background, I’m interested in driving the real-world application of bioinformatics / data science for data-driven decision making. Currently I’m working on a project to understand the impact of various normalisation techniques as well as global / local modelling using clinical data.
