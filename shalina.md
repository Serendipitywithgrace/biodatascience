I am a Year 1 Computer Science student and the project I am working on will first require the coding of a python port for the R package NetProt and performing a more comprehensive benchmark of the methods after the python port is done. This would encompass evaluating how the molecular network features perform on different learners versus gene-level features and determining if biological meaningfulness improves with molecular networks. The objectives of the project include the exploration of the use of molecular networks as features and examining if molecular networks can improve prediction accuracy and produce models that can inform future research.
