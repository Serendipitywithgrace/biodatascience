I am a PhD candidate working on early detection of mental illnesses in youth cohorts. Fascinatingly, around 75% of mental disorders start below the age of 25. During my PhD, I wish to dig deep into the invaluable discipline of mental illnesses and develop paramount applications that will have a positive impact on society.

My expertise lies in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Neuroscience and Algorithms and I’ve got 8 years’ worth of experience as a programmer . If you ever need help with coding or wanna play CSGO, hit me up!
