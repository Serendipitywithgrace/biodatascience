This is Kai Peng. I am an avid biological science student that has grew an eager for bioinformatics/data science - while managing my own photography startup on the sidelines. Giving it my all to stay on top of my ambitious endeavours. Currently, I am working on a task which involves "observing behaviours of gene aggregation methods and transductive inference methods on renal cancer data". I'm also extremely humbled to have an opportunity to be here to learn. 

Just two quotes that I try to live by and remind myself of - which maybe some of you could find relatable. 
"Pursue what is meaningful, not expedient" 
“Face the demands of life voluntarily. Respond to a challenge, instead of bracing for catastrophe.”
