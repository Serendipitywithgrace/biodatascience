I’m a Year 1 currently studying Computer Science, together with the CN Yang Research Programme. I like listening to music, so sometimes I like to play the guitar together with my friends to have a budget karaoke session. I’m also someone who likes playing sports, especially Ultimate Frisbee. However, my competitive spirit has decreased over recent years, and so I prefer playing these sports at a leisure and recreational level.

The project that I will be working together with Dr Goh’s team is called “Artificial Intelligence for predicting mental disease progression in at-risk youths cohorts in Singapore”. I will be assessing the feasibility of using various Machine Learning methods to the sample data, and then benchmarking each of their performances. This is to determine which method is the most suitable for analysing the data, discover possible flaws of the methods and how to go about accounting for the flaws.
