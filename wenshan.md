Yaxing Zhao is a Master student of the School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University. She mainly focuses on missing protein and network-based algorithm.

I am a year 3 undergraduate student from School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My research interests lie in machine learning, bioinformatics and medical image analysis. I am currently involved in a project which aims to develop a novel ranking strategy for missing-protein recovery based on biological networks. I love travelling and exploring new things in my spare time.
