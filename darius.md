I have recently graduated with a Master of Public Health from Monash University. My main interests lie in biostatistics, how we can improve data integrity in biomedical research and apply these to population-wide studies at large. I am currently working on a project which helps to predict mental disease progression in at‚Äêrisk youth cohorts in Singapore, particularly focusing on identifying problems associated with neurocognitive parameters derived from data collected from psychiatric tests, which could enable us to better predict aspects of cognitive function which drive the development of psychosis.
