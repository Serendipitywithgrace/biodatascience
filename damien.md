Iâ€™m currently working on identifying and predicting missing proteins in mass spectrometry proteomics data using network-based PROTREC tool. Solving the missing protein problem is of particular interest due to the nature of MS, wherein every MS experiment, we lose some meaningful proteins due to technical, biological and bioinformatics reasons. PROTREC is developed as an R package that deviates from current similar network-based frequentist (p-value based) methods such as functional class scoring (FCS), GSEA and hypergeometric enrichment, where we apply bayesian statistics and dependent probabilities of the presence of its constituent protein complexes to predict the missing proteins instead.
